Symposium on research is an Annual Event conducted by [CVIT, IIIT](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in/) where students of CVIT will be selected to present their published research. I was given the opportunity to present my research Efficient Semantic Segmentation using Gradual Grouping. CVIT Tech Talk is a weekly meetup to discuss current research papers in Computer vision, Natural language processing, Reinforcement Learning and Robotics. Each presenter of the event has to read a paper and present the paper to the rest of members."
